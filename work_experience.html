                &emsp;I completed an two 18-week software engineering co-op
                terms at Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada,
                during which I helped to pitch and develop an experimental
                professional networking app for government employees to detail
                their knowledge, experience, etc. and search for other with
                specific skills. HR and management took interest in the
                prototype and it is now still receiving funding and development
                as of January 2021.
                <br /><br />
                &emsp; I worked as a fullstack developer. This co-op helped to
                improve my understanding frontend technologies such as React,
                Redux, UI libraries and accesibility tools. My backend skills
                were enhanced by this job too, as it taught me to use
                PostegreSQL for backend development as well as how to use ORMs
                such as Sequelize and Prisma. We also made use of Docker to make
                frontend and backend development more streamlined.

                client designed to work on a variety of platforms.
                <br /><br />
                &emsp;I spent a lot of time developing and testing frontend code
                made with React and Redux, ensuring that the application worked
                properly though Google Chrome and node.js. I also helped to set
                up a Citrix virtual machine enviroment used by companies such as
                banks, and create a solution for running the applicaton in these
                enviroments to avoid issues caused by low bandwidth and high
                latency. This work taught me a great deal about Linux, Bash and
                networking.

                &emsp;I completed an 18-week software engineering co-op at
                Curtis-Wright, a prestigious company created during the merger
                of companies created by people such as Glenn Curtiss and the
                Wright brothers. I worked in the defense-solutions wing, which
                gave be a deep understanding of embedded system development.<br /><br />
                &emsp;The main project I worked on was designing the first
                version of a complex BIOS tool for parsing and modifying Intel
                UEFI firmware images. I was fully responsible for creating code
                and documentation that would be used and expanded on by
                developers in multiple future projects. Working on this project
                allowed me to develop an extremely strong understanding of
                object-oriented Python programming. Furthermore, I made use of
                advanced techniques such as analyzing Python source code and
                extending Python with C to solve problems I faced.<br /><br />
                &emsp;I worked on other smaller projects at Curtiss-Wright as
                well, creating software to help automate the testing of single
                board computers. These projects I worked on gave me the
                opportunity to learn key embedded development tools such as Wind
                River Workbench, Tera Term, WFTPD, Git and Jira. I also learned
                to use Shell Script and Tera Term Language.
